# LanguageLearning

Hey this is my language learning app for helping to read foreign texts. It can help you to learn a language by providing a fast translation to any word or sentence you don't understand.

Try it out [HERE](https://google.com/){:target="\_blank"}!

1. Just copy the text you want to read into the textarea.
2. Highlight any part of the text you don't understand to get an immediate translation.

The project is built in React and uses [Google Cloud Translation API](https://cloud.google.com/translate?hl=en){:target="\_blank"}
.

The UI is made with shadcn components styled with Tailwind CSS.
